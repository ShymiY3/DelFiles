# DelFiles
Delete old files automatically because you're too lazy to do it yourself.

## Requirements:
  - send2trash (pip install send2trash)

## How does it work:
 You have 3 flags: 
  - -p - path to directory in which you remove files (Default: current directory)
  - -d - days of last moification (Default: 30 days)
  - -l - path to create log file (Default: directory in flag -p)
